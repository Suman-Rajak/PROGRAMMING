// 5️⃣ Hoisting in JavaScript 

// we have a creation phase and execution phase.

// Hoisting in Javascript is a mechanism where variables and functions
// declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code execute.


// For Example 👇
// console.log(myName); // will print undefined because we are printing before decalration
// var myName; // If we use let instead of var then it will give an error.
// myName = "thapa";



//😲 In ES2015 (a.k.a. ES6), hoisting is avoided by using the let keyword 
// instead of var. (The other difference is that variables declared 
// with let are local to the surrounding block, not the entire function.)
