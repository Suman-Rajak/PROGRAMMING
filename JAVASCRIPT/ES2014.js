// "use strict"

/** If we use "use strict" then we have to follow the tranditional method of javacsript

    Ex:- 

    ---without use strict----

    x = 3.14;
    console.log(x); //output will be 3.14



    ---with use strict----

    "use strict";
     x = 3.14;
     console.log(x); //Now it will give error


     So, we have to write,

     "use strict"
     let x = 3.14;
     console.log(x); //now output will be 3.14
