// 7️⃣ What is Closures in JavaScript 🤔

// A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references 
// to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 

// In other words, a closure gives you 
// access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. 

// In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


// For Example 👇

// const outerFun = (a) => {
//     let b = 10;
//     const innerFun = () => {
//       let sum = a+b;
//       console.log(`the sum of the two no is ${sum}`);
//     }
//     innerFun();
// }
// outerFun(5); 

// it same like lexical scoping 

// // One more Example 👇



// const outerFun = (a) => {
//   let b = 10;
//   const innerFun = () => {
//     let sum = a+b;
//     console.log(`the sum of the two no is ${sum}`);
//   }
//   return innerFun;
// }
// let checkClousure = outerFun(5);
// console.dir(checkClousure);


//The values of parents are stored in closures so that the childs can access it.
