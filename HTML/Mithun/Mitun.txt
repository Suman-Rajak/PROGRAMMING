        <font size="4">Ans:- Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this
            warming
            trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due
            to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels
            burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the
            “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.

            Forty percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions stem from electricity production. Ninety-three percent of the
            electric industry emissions result from burning coal. According to the EPA coal-fired power plants,
            municipal and medical waste incineration account for two-thirds of U.S. mercury emissions.</li><br>

            </b>
            Industrial farming and ranching releases huge levels of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
            Farming contributes forty percent of the methane and twenty percent of the carbon dioxide to worldwide
            emissions.</li><br>

            </b>
            Deforestation to use wood for building materials, paper and fuel increases global warming in two ways -- the
            release of carbon dioxide during the deforestation process and the reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide
            that forests can capture.</li><br>

                <font size="4">Fertilizers:-
            </b>
            The use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers increases the amount of heat cropland can store. Nitrogen oxides can
            trap up to 300 times more heat than carbon dioxide. Sixty-two percent of nitrous oxide released comes from
            agricultural byproducts.</li><br>

            </b>
            Burn-off from the oil drilling industry impacts the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Fossil fuel
            retrieval, processing and distribution accounts for roughly eight percent of carbon dioxide and thirty
            percent of methane pollution.</li><br>

            </b>
            Touted as a cleaner fuel source, natural gas drilling causes massive air pollution in states like Wyoming;
            the hydraulic fracturing technique used to extract natural gas from shale deposits pollutes ground water
            sources as well.</li><br>

            As trash breaks down in landfills, it releases methane and nitrous oxide gases. Approximately eighteen
            percent of methane gas in the atmosphere comes from waste disposal and treatment.</li><br>

            Volcanoes expel large quantities of carbon dioxide when they erupt. Volcanoes have an overall small effect
            on global warming and an eruption causes a short-term global cooling as ash in the air reflects greater
            amounts of solar energy.</li><br>

        <li>
            <font size="4"></font>Trees absorb carbon dioxide which makes up 82% of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere,
            so planting more trees can help reduce the amount of carbon in our atmosphere. In fact, we could remove
            roughly two-thirds of human-made carbon just by letting all forests regrow, according to a study published
            in the journal of Science.

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            <font size="4"></font>As aforementioned, cars are one of the biggest contributors to climate change: 82% of
            emissions from transportation come from cars. And while cutting automotive transportation out of your life
            would make the most impact, this isn’t possible for most people. So instead, tweak a few habits that will
            have a bigger collective impact.

        <li>
            <font size="4"></font>If you refrain from harsh braking and rapid acceleration, you can cut your fuel
            consumption by as much as 40%, according to the US Department of Energy. If you also keep your tires
            inflated and car maintained, you’ll cut your fuel consumption by nearly half when driving.

            <font size="4"></font>Electricity is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gas emissions, and heating
            systems are the single biggest energy expense in the home. So lowering your heating bills is the most
            impactful way to reduce your electricity consumption.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <font size="4"></font>In addition to monitoring your thermostat, improving insulation and airtightness
            through your walls, roof, and windows is a great way to avoid heat from escaping your home, since the
            biggest sources of heat loss are your walls (35%), roof (20%), and windows (15%).
